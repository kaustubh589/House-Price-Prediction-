# Description
This  model is a type of predictive model that utilizes historical data on house prices, along with various other relevant factors, to predict the price of a house. The model can be trained on a dataset of past house sales to learn patterns and relationships between different features (e.g. number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.) and their corresponding sale prices. Once trained, the model can then be used to make predictions on new data, estimating the price of a house based on its features. This type of model can be useful for real estate professionals, home buyers, and sellers looking to understand the potential value of a property.

# Features
Input data: This includes a range of features that are relevant to predicting house prices, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, lot size, location, age of the property, and various other factors.

Data preprocessing: The data may need to be cleaned and preprocessed before being fed into the model. This can involve tasks such as handling missing data, converting categorical data into numerical values, and scaling or normalizing the features.

Algorithm selection: Different machine learning algorithms can be used for house price prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Training and testing: The model is trained on a dataset of past house sales, and the accuracy of the model is tested using a separate dataset of house prices that were not used during training.

Evaluation metrics: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to determine how well the model is able to predict house prices.

Deployment: The final trained model can be deployed to make predictions on new data, such as estimating the price of a house that is currently on the market.
